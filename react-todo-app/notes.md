React is declarative: you describe what the UI should look like.
Vanilla JS is imperative: you instruct the DOM step by step.
Reactâ€™s big power: managing complexity as apps grow.
Why Do We Need a Setup?
In vanilla JS, we could just drop a <script> tag in HTML and write code.
But React needs a bit more:

JSX (looks like HTML in JS) â†’ browsers donâ€™t understand it directly.
A bundler to prepare the code.
A dev server to reload changes quickly.
ðŸ‘‰ Thatâ€™s why we need tools to prepare our React code before the browser sees it.

The Tools
Node.js + npm: Like the toolbox. npm helps us install libraries.
Vite: A fast setup tool (like an instant kitchen â€” all ingredients prepped).
VS Code: Our editor (like Microsoft Word but for code).

Step-by-Step Setup
Step 1: Install Node.js
Go to https://nodejs.org.
Download the LTS version (long-term support).
Install it.
Check in terminal:
node -v
npm -v
Step 2: Create a New React Project with Vite
In your terminal:

npm create vite@latest react-todo-app
Choose React.
Use JavaScript (not TypeScript for now).
Go into the folder:
cd react-todo-app
npm install
npm run dev
ðŸŽ‰ You should see your app at http://localhost:5173.

In React, everything is a component.
A component is just a function that returns some UI (written in JSX).
JSX = JavaScript + XML-like syntax.
It looks like HTML, but itâ€™s actually syntactic sugar for React.createElement.
Why Components Matter
Reusable: Build once, use many times.
Organized: Split big UIs into small, clear pieces.
Readable: Code is easier to follow.
Components = functions that return UI.
Write once, use anywhere with <ComponentName />.
Apps are just a tree of components.
